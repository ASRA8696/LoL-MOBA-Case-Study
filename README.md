League of Legends is a Multiplayer Online Battleground Arena (MOBA) style game developed by Riot Games. Each game consists of two teams with five players each. Each team starts the game at opposite sides of the arena in a base that contains their Nexus. The goal of each game is to overcome obstacles such as minions, structures, and enemy players to destroy the enemy Nexus. Each team has five standard positions across the map: Top, Middle, Jungle, Attack Damage Carry(ADC)/Marksman, and Support. Each player in a match, usually between twenty minutes and an hour, controls a unique champion chosen from a pool of more than a hundred with differing characteristics and abilities. 

## DATASETS

### [League of Legends Public API](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis)

The League of Legends Public API is a freely accessible interface that provides access to various data related to the popular online multiplayer game League of Legends. This API retrieves information on game statistics such as player profiles, match histories, performance metrics, player rankings, champion statistics, and match details. The data is returned in JSON format, making it easy to process and work with. 

### [Data Dragon](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol)

Data Dragon is a resource provided by Riot Games, the developer of League of Legends, that contains all the game's static data, such as champions, items, maps, and other game assets that do not change during gameplay. Data Dragon is available in compressed JSON files, making it easy to download and process. One can further use data from Data Dragon to build League of Legends-related applications or perform exploratory data analysis. Not all static files can be found on the data dragon. Some assets were obtained from this [GitHub repository]([url](https://github.com/InFinity54/LoL_DDragon)).
